# draft-fantasy-data

Some examples of data wrangling with high level pandas functions.  

Originally intended to show off how well I was doing in our Draft Fantasy, I shelved this project when I slipped down the league.

The drive to understand more about Pandas/NumPy has forced me to pick it up again!

## Running the project

Linux/OSX:

`docker-compose up`

Windows

`winpty docker-compose up`

The project is contained in the notebook: 

`'data_wrangling.ipynb'`  

No external data is required.
